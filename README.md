#PoET
## Overview
PoET is a command line tool for extracting data from the Path of Exile content package.

## Installation
PoET was developed against [Python 3.2.3](http://www.python.org/download/). As such, you require a Python 3.x interpreter to use it. PoET is simple to use. Here is an example:

    $ poet.py extract "path/to/Content.ggpk" "directory/to/extract/to"

You may pass -h to the script to receive more detailed help.
